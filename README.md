**[E-Commerce Microservices](https://github.com/nasimjafari7/CSharpProjects/blob/main/MicroSysECommerce/ProjectDesc.ipynb):** In this project, I created four e-commerce microservices; **Products**, **Customers**, **Orders**, and **Search**. The first three microservices will manage their own data. The Search microservice will synchronously communicate to the other microservices to obtain data from a particular customer and return the aggregated data. To accomplish this, I used some technologies, libraries, and design patterns such as **ASP .Net Core, Entity Framework, Restful Web APIs, HTTPClient, AutoMapper, Dependency Injection** and also **xUnit** to test some functionalities automatically. [This](https://github.com/nasimjafari7/CSharpProjects/tree/main/MicroSysECommerce/MicroSysECommerce) is the link to the source code of the project.
